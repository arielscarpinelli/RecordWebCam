# RecordWebCam

An iOS camera app to record locally in 4k and broadcast at same time to OBS for monitoring or live streaming


## Intro

Most phone-as-webcam apps have at least one of these issues
- Charge you an expensive subscription for an app that is ALL LOCAL
- Present frame skip at 4k, or don't support 4k at all
- Don't support portrait mode
- Don't record the footage in the phone, potentially loosing it if anything happens with the computer.
- Require you to buy a USB-C or Lighning adapter to HDMI; and then another HDMI to USB-C 4k dongle for connecting back to the computer.

This app attempts to solve all those issues, allowing you to record in your phone while broadcasting in full 4k res with no delay, via USB, FOR FREE.
